## ‚ú® Key Features

XML Genius is designed to be the definitive tool for all XML-related tasks, combining powerful backend logic with a clean, intuitive user interface.

* **Advanced Validation:** Instantly check if an XML file is well-formed. For folders, recursively find all XML files and get a batch summary of valid and invalid documents.
* **Intelligent Repair:** For documents with mismatched closing tags, use the one-click "Repair with Top" or "Repair with Bottom" functions to instantly fix the file.
* **Interactive Tree Visualization:** Don't just read XML‚Äîsee it. Untangle complex nested structures with a zoomable, collapsible, and pannable node graph that makes understanding document hierarchy effortless.
* **Live XML Editor:** Open any XML document in a full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting. Make direct changes, add or remove nodes, and save your work with confidence.
* **Smart, Context-Aware Actions:** The application is smart. It knows whether you've selected a file or a folder and enables only the relevant actions, streamlining your workflow.
* **Cross-Platform:** Built with Electron, XML Genius runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (For Developers)

To get a local copy up and running for development, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8+)
* A C/C++ compiler (for running the core logic executables)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/XMLGenius.git](https://github.com/your-username/XMLGenius.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Frontend (Electron & React):**
    ```sh
    cd electron-vite-project  # Or your frontend folder name
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the Backend (Python):**
    *First, create a `requirements.txt` file in your `backend` folder with the following content:*
    ```txt
    # backend/requirements.txt
    fastapi
    uvicorn[standard]
    ```
    *Now, set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:*
    ```sh
    cd ../backend # Go back to the root and into the backend folder
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two terminals running simultaneously for development.

1.  **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate
    python3 main.py
    ```
    Your Python API will now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Application**
    ```sh
    cd electron-vite-project
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your Electron desktop application will launch and will be able to communicate with the backend.
